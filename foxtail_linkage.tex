\section*{Abstract}

\section*{Introduction}
The genetic architecture of fitness-related traits has been a major focus of geneticists for 
over a century \citep[reviewed by][]{Ellegren:2008}. Genetic architecture refers to the number, type, effect size, 
genomic organization, interactions, and environmental dependency of the loci contributing to phenotypic variation 
which in turn creates variation in fitness among individuals within populations \citep[cf.][]{Eckert:2012a}. 
Interest in this architecture stems from the want to explain the nature of genetic variation which 
contributes to evolution via the accumulation of adaptations within lineages (i.e., adaptive evolution).
Early efforts to understand the genetic architecture of fitness-related traits
focused primarily on the number and effect size of the loci underlying heritable, phenotypic variation \citep{Fisher:1918}. 
Recent work has extended this line of research, with myriad studies linking phenotypic with genetic variation 
through linkage mapping, both within pedigrees \citep{Mauricio:2001, Neale:2011, Ritland:2011} and within 
natural populations \citep{Ingvarsson:2011, Eckert:2013a}, 
or through quantitative genetic experimentation \citep{Anderson:2013a, Anderson:2013b, Fournier-Level:2013}. Relatively 
little empirical work outside of model organisms, however, has focused on the genomic organization 
of loci contributing to fitness differences 
among individuals \citep[but see][]{Stevison:2011}. This is despite clear theoretical predictions relating the evolution of 
the genetic architecture underlying fitness-related traits to the genomic organization of the loci comprising this architecture 
\citep{Kirkpatrick:2006, Yeaman:2011, Yeaman:2013}.

Evidence for adaptive evolution among populations of plants is commonly documented at both the phenotypic 
and molecular levels \citep{Kawecki:2004, Pannell:2013}, so that some of the best
examples of adaptive evolution within lineages comes from the field of plant genetics \citep[e.g.,][]{Antonovics:1970}. 
Despite this evidence, relatively little work has focused explicitly on the genomic organization of loci contributing
to these patterns\citep{Hoffman:2008}, which likely stemmed from the lack of genomic resources for plants relative to animals.
Adaptive evolution has been extensively documented for forest trees, especially conifers, with many instances of 
local adaptation clearly being documented over the past century \citep{White:2007, Neale:2011}. Despite great advances 
in experimental technology, empirical focus has remained almost fully on the number, effect size, type, and interactions 
among loci contributing to adaptive evolution \citep{Neale:2011, Alberto:2013}.  A thorough examination of the 
genetic architecture of fitness-related traits, however, should also include 
an examination of the genomic organization of the loci contributing to trait variation. Here, we leverage 
this idea in the first of a series of papers dissecting the genetic architecture of fitness-related 
traits in a non-model conifer species, foxtail pine (\textit{Pinus balfouriana} Grev. \& Balf.), with the 
ultimate goal of testing explicit evolutionary hypotheses about the genomic organization of loci 
contributing to variation in fitness-related traits.

Ideally, the genomic organization of loci contributing to variation in fitness-related traits would follow 
naturally from the production of a genome sequence (i.e., a physical map). For many taxa, especially those with 
small to modest genome sizes, this is monetarily and computationally feasible using next-generation DNA sequencing 
technologies \citep{Koboldt:2013}. For taxa with large or complex genomes, however, even the advent of next generation DNA 
sequencing does not solve the complexity and cost hurdles associated with the production of a finished genome sequence. Conifers 
have large and complex genomes \citep{Murray:1998, Ahuja:2005}, with estimated average genome sizes in \textit{Pinus} in the 
range of \SIrange{20}{30}{Gbp}. Several genome projects, each of which involves many laboratories, are underway or have been 
completed \citep{Mackay:2012}. Even these efforts often initially result in limited information, however,
as for example the current assemblies of the Norway spruce (\textit{Picea abies} L.) and loblolly pine (\textit{Pinus taeda} L.) genomes 
contain millions of unordered contigs with average sizes in the thousands of base pairs \citep{Nystedt:2013}. An alternative, 
but not mutually exclusive, approach to describing the genome of an organism 
is that of linkage mapping. In this approach, genetic markers are ordered through observations of recombination events 
within pedigrees. This approach dates to the beginning of genetics and the logic has remained relatively unchanged 
since the first linkage maps were created in \textit{Drosophila} \citep{Sturtevant:1913}.

Renewed interest in linkage maps has occurred for two reasons. First, linkage maps can be used to order contigs 
created during genome sequencing projects \citep{Mackay:2012, Martinez-Garcia:2013}. In this fashion, linkage 
maps are used to help create larger contigs from those generated during the assembly. It is these larger contigs that 
create the utility that most practicing scientists attribute to genome sequences. Second, linkage maps are relatively 
easy to produce and provide a rich context with which to interpret population and quantitative genetic patterns of variation 
\citep[e.g.,][]{Eckert:2010a, Eckert:2010b, Eckert:2013a, Yeaman:2013}. They can also be used to test explicit hypotheses about 
the organization of loci contributing to adaptive evolution. For example, \citet{Yeaman:2011} developed theoretical 
predictions about the genomic organization of loci underlying patterns of local adaptation as a function of gene flow, 
so that loci contributing to local adaptation have differing spatial structure within genomes as a result of differing 
regimes of gene flow. The relevant scale \citep[\textit{sensu}][]{Houle:2011} in these mathematical formulations is that 
of recombinational distance among loci, so that when matched with an appropriate study system, 
linkage maps provide the impetus to test basic evolutionary hypotheses. In this context, future additions of finished 
genome sequences would add only to the interpretation of results.

Construction of linkage maps have a long history within forest genetics, mostly through their use in quantitative trait locus 
mapping \citep{Ritland:2011}. Conifers in particular are highly amenable to linkage mapping, with approximately 25 different 
species currently having some form of linkage map completed \citep[see Table 5-1 in][]{Ritland:2011}. Much of the amenability of 
conifers to linkage mapping stems from the early establishment of breeding populations in economically important species and from 
the presence of a multicellular female gametophyte (i.e., the megagametophyte) from which the haploid product of maternal meiosis 
can be observed \citep{Cairney:2007}. Indeed, many of the first linkage maps in conifers were generated from collections of 
megagametophytes made from single trees \citep{Tulsieram:1992, Nelson:1993, Kubisiak:1996}. Continued development 
of genetic marker technologies has facilitated rapid development of linkage maps across a diversity of species, with the largest maps 
generated for economically important species \citep[e.g.][] {Achere:2004, Kang:2010, Martinez-Garcia:2013}. 
The development of biologically informative markers in non-economically important conifers, however, is hampered by production costs 
associated with the development of characterized  genetic markers (i.e., those with a known DNA sequence and/or function). 
The majority of this cost is in the two-step approach needed to generate biologically 
meaningful markers: polymorphism discovery via DNA sequencing followed by genotyping of those polymorphisms 
\citep[cf.][]{Eckert:2013a}. As a result, the vast majority of linkage maps outside of economically important 
species are created with uncharacterized genetic markers \citep[e.g.,][]{Travis:1998}. Much of the knowledge about the genetic 
architecture of fitness-related traits outside of a handful of economically important conifer species, therefore, is about the 
number and effect size of uncharacterized genetic markers \citep{Ritland:2011}. Cost restrictions, however, have largely disappeared. 
It is now feasible to jointly discover polymorphisms and genotype samples using high-throughput DNA sequencing 
approaches, such as restriction-associated DNA sequencing \citep [RADseq; e.g.,][] {Peterson:2012}. 

The generation of linkage maps from RADseq data is a complex endeavor due to the inherent stochasticity
and error prone nature of these data. Recent examples in several crop species highlight the
difficulties that must be overcome with respect to missing data and errors in calling polymorphic sites 
and the resulting genotypes \citep{Pfender:2011, Ward:2013}. Despite these difficulties, RADseq has been 
successively applied to samples taken from natural populations of non-model conifer species \citep{Parchman:2012}, but has not yet 
been applied to linkage mapping in these species, so that an exploration of these methods to linkage mapping in the large and complex 
genomes of conifers is warranted. Here, we take this approach using megagametophyte arrays from four maternal trees of foxtail pine
to generate maternal linkage maps comprised of thousands of loci. There are currently no published linkage 
maps for this species, which is only distantly related to loblolly pine \citep{Eckert:2006a}, nor any within the subsection \textit{Balfourianae}. 
By doing so, we examine the inherent biases to the generation of RADseq data in conifer genomes and how these biases affect
downstream inferences of linkage maps. We subsequently discuss
the utility of our inferred linkage maps to comparative genomics within the conifers and to tests of how patterns of gene flow 
affect the genomic organization of loci underlying fitness-related traits.


\section*{Materials and Methods}\label{ss:mats}

\subsection*{Focal species}
Foxtail pine is a five needle species of \textit{Pinus} classified into 
subsection \textit{Balfourianae}, section \textit{Parrya}, and subgenus \textit{Strobus} 
\citep{Gernandt:2005}. It is one of three species within subsection \textit{Balfourianae} 
\citep{Bailey:1970} and generally is regarded as the sister species to Great Basin bristlecone 
pine \citep[\textit{P. longaeva} D. K. Bailey; see][] {Eckert:2006a}. The natural range of foxtail pine encompasses two 
regional populations located within California that are separated by approximately \SI{500}{km}:  
the Klamath Mountains of northern California and the Sierra Nevada of southern California 
(Figure \ref{f:Figure01_TGG}). These regional populations diverged approximately one million years ago (mya), 
with current levels of gene flow between regional populations being approximately zero 
\citep{Eckert:2008}. Within each regional population, levels of genetic diversity and the 
degree of differentiation among local stands differ, with genetic diversity being highest in 
the southern Sierra Nevada stands and genetic differentiation being the highest among the 
Klamath stands \citep{Oline:2000, Eckert:2008}. These two regional populations
have also been recognized as distinct subspecies based on numerous quantitative traits, with \textit{P. balfouriana}
subsp.\ \textit{balfouriana} located in the Klamath region and \textit{P. balfouriana} subsp.\ \textit{austrina} located 
in the southern Sierra Nevada mountains \citep{Mastrogiuseppe:1980}. The two regional populations of foxtail pine 
thus represent a powerful natural experiment within which to examine the genomic organization of loci contributing to 
local adaptation. The first step in using this system to test evolutionary hypotheses is the production of a
dense linkage map \citep[cf.][]{Pannell:2013}.

\subsection*{Sampling}
Seed collections from 141 maternal trees distributed throughout the natural range 
of foxtail pine were obtained during 2011 and 2012. Of these 141 maternal trees, 72 were sampled from the 
Klamath region, while 69 were sampled from the southern Sierra Nevada region. These 141 families were
divided among 15 local stands ($n = \text{\SIrange{4}{17}{trees/stand}}$), with eight stands in the Klamath region and seven 
stands in the southern Sierra Nevada.
Approximately 50 seeds were germinated from each seed collection and 35 of those 50 seedlings were planted in a 
common garden located at the USDA Institute of Forest Genetics, Placerville, California (Figure \ref{f:Figure01_TGG}). The 
common garden was established using a randomized block design and involved three separate plantings of seeds spanning
approximately one year from June 6, 2012 until May 20, 2013. Four of the 141 maternal trees were selected 
at random ($n = 2$ from the Klamath region and $n = 2$ from the southern Sierra Nevada) for linkage analysis. Libraries were color-coded and are referred to as
red (southern Sierra Nevada), green (southern Sierra Nevada), blue (Klamath), and yellow (Klamath).
For each of these trees, \SIrange{75}{100}{} seeds were germinated and planted in the common garden. 
Upon germination, haploid megagametophyte tissue was rescued from each seedling, cleaned by removing 
soil and other extraneous materials with water, and stored for further 
analysis in \SI{1.5}{\mL} Eppendorf tubes at \SI{-20}{\celsius}.

\subsection*{Library Preparation and Sequencing}
Total genomic DNA was isolated from each rescued megagametophyte using the DNeasy 96 Plant 
kit following the manufacturer’s protocol (Qiagen, Germantown, MD). RADseq \citep{Davey:2010, Parchman:2012, Peterson:2012} 
was used to generate a genome-wide set of 
single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers for linkage mapping following the protocol 
outlined by \citet{Parchman:2012}. In brief, this protocol is a double-digestion, RADseq 
approach based on digestion of total genomic DNA using EcoRI and MseI followed by single-end 
sequencing on the Illumina HiSeq platform. Following digestion, adapters 
containing amplification and sequencing primers, as well as barcodes for multiplexing, 
were ligated to the digested DNA fragments. We chose to multiplex 96 samples using the 
barcodes available from \citet{Parchman:2012}. One of these samples, per set of 96, was a pseudo-diploid
constructed by pooling five megagametophytes sampled from the same maternal tree. We used the genotype of the
pseudo-diploid sample as that of the maternal genotype, although there is a probability of $0.5^{4} = 0.0625$ that 
the genotype for any given SNP will be mistakenly called homozygous due to the five megagametophytes all being of the 
same allele \citep[see][]{Morris:1978}.
These barcodes are a mixture of \SI{8}{bp}, \SI{9}{bp}, and \SI{10}{bp} tags that differ by at least four bases. 
Following ligation, successfully ligated DNA fragments were 
amplified using PCR and amplified fragments were size selected using gel electrophoresis. We selected 
fragments in the size range of 400 bp (\SIrange{300}{500}{bp}) by excising and purifying pooled DNA from 2.5\% 
agarose gels using QIAquick Gel Extraction Kits (Qiagen). Further details, including relevant reagents and 
oligonucleotide sequences, can be found in File S1. All DNA sequencing was performed on the Illumina HiSeq 2000 or 2500
platform at the VCU Nucleic Acids Research Facility (\url{http://www.narf.vcu.edu/}).

\subsection*{DNA Sequence Analysis}\label{ss:dna}
There are multiple steps involved with the processing of raw DNA sequence reads into a set of SNP genotypes that are 
useful for linkage mapping: (1) quality control, filtering, and demultiplexing, (2) assembly to generate a reference 
sequence for mapping reads, (3) mapping of reads to call SNPs and genotypes for each sample, and (4) filtering of SNPs 
and the resulting genotypes for data quality and biological meaning.

DNA sequence reads were demultiplexed into sample-level fastq files, following quality control 
and filtering.  The filtering pipeline was adapted from \citep{Friedline:2012fm}, and is briefly: reads 
containing any N beyond the first base were excluded. Reads having N as the first base were shifted 
to exclude it.  Additional quality filtering ensured that all reads in the resulting set for downstream 
processing had a minimum average quality score of 30 over 5 bp, overlapping windows 
and that not more than \SI{20}{\percent} of the bases had quality scores below 30. Reads passing the 
quality control steps were demultiplexed into sample-specific fastq files by exact pattern matching to 
known barcodes.

From each set of demultiplexed reads, the individual with the largest number of reads as assembled using 
Velvet (Zerbino, version 1.2.10), with hash length ($k$) coverage cutoff optimized using parameter sweeps of $k$ 
through the contributed VelvetOptimiser (\url{http://www.vicbioinformatics.com}, version 2.2.5) 
script (for odd $k$ on $k=[19,65]$).  Assembly robustness was evaluated in each case using the LAP likelihood 
framework \citep{Ghodsi:2013bc}, version 1.1 (svn commit r186).  Each assembly was also indexed and aligned 
(Figure \ref{f:mapping_performance}) to the original set of reads 
using Bowtie2 \citep{Langmead:2012jh} (\texttt{--local --very-sensitive}) and compared to the average maximum 
likelihood estimate. In all cases, the assembly with the highest average maximum likelihood value was 
chosen as the reference for SNP calling (Figure \ref{f:mapping_performance}).

SNPs were called for all individuals against their respective reference using a variety of methods.  First, 
reads were mapped to the reference with Bowtie2 (\texttt{--local --very-sensitive-local}).  These resulting 
sam files were converted their binary equivalent (e.g., bam) using \texttt{samtools} version 0.1.19 
(\texttt{view, sort, index}) \citep{Li:2009ka}.  SNPs were called using \texttt{bcftools} and filtered using 
\texttt{vcfutils} to exclude SNPs with less than 100x coverage. The resulting variant call files (vcf) 
were further processed using \texttt{vcftools} version 0.1.11 (cite) to remove indels and exclude genotype 
calls below a quality threshold of 5, and output as a matrix (\texttt{--012}) of genotypes by individuals.  

We used several thresholds to filter called SNPs for linkage mapping. First, 
we excluded SNPs using a $\chi^2$ test of homogeneity against an expectation of 1:1 segregation. This segregation 
pattern was expected because the maternal tree had to be a heterozygote to detect a SNP, and Mendel's first law 
guarantees that the segregation ratio for this SNP should be 1:1. Significance of each test was 
assessed using a Bonferroni-corrected significance threshold of $\alpha = 0.05$, where $\alpha$ was corrected using the 
number of SNPs tested. Second, we filtered the resulting SNPs based on the genotype of the pseudo-diploid sample so as 
to keep only those SNPs where the pseudo-diploid was either 1) called a heterozygote or 2) had a missing genotype call.
Lastly, we filtered the resulting SNPs so as keep only those that had a minimum of $5$ genotype calls for each of the 
alternate alleles. The resulting subset of SNPs was then used as the input to linkage analysis.

\subsection*{Linkage Analysis}\label{ss:linkage}
The production of a linkage map for a single tree requires three main steps: (1) calculation of 
pairwise distances between all pairs of loci, (2) clustering (i.e., grouping) of loci based on these pairwise distances, 
and (3) ordering of loci within each cluster \citep{Cheema:2009}.  A variety of software packages exist to carry out these steps 
\citep[e.g.,][]{VanOoijen:2011}. Traditional software packages for linkage mapping, however, are not amenable to large 
amounts of missing data and frequent errors in genotype calls. The former causes issues with all aspects of analysis, while 
the latter primarily affects the genetic distances between markers \citep{Hackett:2003, Cartwright:2007}. We thus followed the approach 
of \citet{Ward:2013}, which was designed specifically for RADseq data. 

In brief, this method can be described as follows. Pairwise distances were estimated and loci were clustered using a 
custom R script \citep{R:2013}. We used MSTmap \citep{Wu:2008a} 
to infer marker order and Maskov \citep{Ward:2013} to impute and correct genotypes. The algorithms available
in MSTmap can also be used to impute and correct genotype errors \citep[see][]{Wu:2008a}, but the amount of missing
data and putative genotyping errors in our RADseq data far surpassed those used to develop this software. These two programs
were used in an iterative fashion. MSTmap was used initially to order markers, which was followed by the use of Maskov
to impute and correct putative genotype errors conditional on this initial marker ordering. A last round of ordering 
was performed using MSTmap conditional on the imputed and error corrected genotype data. This general schema
was followed for each of the four maternal trees independently.

The relevant pairwise distance for linkage mapping in our haploid case is defined as the probability 
of observing a recombination event between two haplotypes. This probability can be calculated for a set of 
biallelic loci using the Hamming distance ($d_{i,j}$).
The Hamming distance is the number of differences separating two binary strings \citep{Hamming:1950}, which are 
in this case, the haploid genotypes for a set of two megagametophytes. 
This distance, scaled by the number of positions (i.e., $d_{i,j}/n$), 
is the maximum likelihood estimate of the probability of a recombination event with respect to a pair of haplotypes 
in a double haploid design \citep{Wu:2008a}. It is also an estimate of the recombination fraction, so that these distances can be transformed into LOD 
scores \citep[see][]{Morton:1955}. Missing data were dealt with in a pairwise manner, so that each pairwise comparison had 
missing data removed prior to estimation of $d_{i,j}/n$. When values of $d_{i,j}/n$ exceeded 0.5, which is the theoretical maximum 
value given the expected 1:1 segregation pattern, they were set to 0.5.  The $d_{i,j}/n$ values were used to construct the 
pairwise distance matrix between all possible pairs of loci passing our quality thresholds.

Loci were clustered hierarchically based on the pairwise distance matrix using Ward's method as the linkage function \citep{Ward:1963}.
The values of $d_{i,j}/n$ were squared prior to use of Ward's method in hierarchical clustering.
The accuracy of this method was explored via simulation of a single maternal tree with two chromosomes each
with 100 loci. Levels of missing data and genotyping error were introduced to match those from the observed data.
More information about these simulations is given in File S1.
We explored groupings ($K$) based on clustering on the interval $K=[8,16]$. This interval was 
chosen because it brackets the haploid chromosome number of foxtail pine ($1N = 12$). This entailed 
cutting the resulting dendrogram at a specific height, so that the desired number of groups resulted. 
Solutions were compared using silhouette widths for each locus \citep{Rousseeuw:1987}. 
The value of $K$ which maximized the number of loci for which the silhouette width was maximal 
across the different values of $K$ was selected as optimal.

Ordering of loci within clusters was carried out using MSTmap \citep{Wu:2008a}. This method takes a full, undirected graph where 
nodes are loci and edges are based on the values of $d_{i,j}/n$ and finds the correct order of markers based on the minimum-weighted 
traveling salesman path (TSP). \citet{Wu:2008a} showed that the minimum-weighted TSP can be found using a minimum spanning tree approach 
and that it corresponds to the correct order of the loci if the minimum spanning tree on the full, undirected graph is unique. We 
employed MSTmap using the maximum likelihood objective function, grouping turned off, imputation of missing data turned off, and the 
Kosambi mapping function \citep{Kosambi:1944}. The resulting ordering of loci within each cluster, along with the distances (i.e., cM) 
in each cluster, were taken as the initial linkage map from which data were error-corrected and imputed.
 
Data were subsequently imputed and corrected for errors using Maskov \citep{Ward:2013}. A full account of the mechanics of the algorithm 
used in Maskov can be found in Text S1 from \citet{Ward:2013}. For our purposes, the accuracy of the imputation and 
error correction depends upon two choices: (1) the threshold for missing data for a given megagametophyte and (2) the number of 
contiguous loci where genotype errors can occur. We chose a value equal to the $75^{th}$ percentile for the amount of 
missing data across megagametophytes for the former and a value of 5\% of the number of loci in the initial map for each 
cluster for the latter \citet[cf.][]{Ward:2013}.

A final round of ordering was conducted with the imputed and error corrected data using MSTmap as described previously. Imputation 
and error correction resulted in many loci where $d_{i,j}/n = 0$. These co-segregating markers were thus mapped to the same bin 
\citep[see][]{Wu:2008a}. The collection of resulting ordered clusters was taken as the final linkage map for each of the four maternal trees. 
The end result of the linkage analysis was thus four independent linkage maps, one per maternal tree.

\subsection*{Sensitivity Analysis}
The production of linkage maps for each maternal tree required many assumptions.
Given that the inferred maps will be used in downstream analyses, including acting as aids
to help impute missing data in population-level sampling, we explored the effect of these assumptions on 
the resulting linkage maps using sensitivity analysis. The effect of assumptions 
were examined by modifying threshold values defining each assumption. We selected the
data from the maternal tree with the largest number of reads as the focal linkage map with which to explore
the sensitivity of our results to our assumptions.

First, we explored the effect of assumptions made during the process of read mapping to detect SNPs and call genotypes 
\citep[cf.][]{Pool:2010}. The mapping of reads requires a reference against which to match reads based on their similarity. 
The assembly process, however, requires optimization of the hash length (see \nameref{ss:dna}), 
which in turn affects the quality of the contigs comprising the assembly \citep{Earl:2011gt,Salzberg:2011fr,Bradnam:2013uu}.  
Since it is the contigs in the assembly that directly affect the ability to map reads and hence call SNPs, we explored the effect 
of assembly choice on SNP calling. We selected the next best assemblies flanking the assembly identified as optimal via maximum likelihood 
and for each performed SNP calling as described previously. When loci were shared across SNP sets (see \nameref{ss:dna}), we 
conducted linkage mapping as described previously (i.e., we used all of the other previous thresholds unless otherwise noted) for each 
set and compared the resulting maps of the shared loci using Spearman rank correlations \citep{Spearman:1904}.  
The significance of each comparison was tested via permutation analysis ($n = 10,000$ permutations) using a Bonferroni-corrected significance 
threshold of $\alpha = 0.05$. Non-significant values were taken as evidence of significantly different orderings.

Second, we explored the use of thresholds for segregation distortion and 
use of the pseudo-diploid sample to call the maternal genotype to filter SNPs prior to linkage mapping. 
We modified the significance threshold to Bonferroni-corrected values of $\alpha = 0.01, 0.05,$ 
and $0.10$ to study the effects of segregation distortion on the resulting map. 
Lastly, we built linkage maps with and without use of the pseudo-diploid based filtering. Comparisons among the resulting linkage 
maps were made in a fully factorial design and maps were compared using pairwise Spearman correlation coefficients 
(i.e., {$6 \choose 2$} = $15$ unique comparisons). The significance of each correlation coefficient 
was tested using permutation analysis ($n = 10,000$ permutations) and a Bonferroni-corrected significance threshold of $\alpha = 0.05$. 
Non-significant values were taken as evidence of significantly different orderings. In all cases, linkage mapping as described previously 
(i.e., we used all of the other previous thresholds unless otherwise noted) was carried out for each of the resulting SNP sets based on 
the optimal assembly.

Lastly, we explored the thresholds used in imputation and error correction. We varied the threshold upon which 
we allowed the maximum amount of missing data, as this may affect the uniqueness 
or non-uniqueness of the minimum spanning tree used during ordering of the loci. Specifically, 
we examined the effects of using as the threshold, the $10^{th}$, $25^{th}$, $50^{th}$, $75^{th}$, and $95^{th}$ percentiles of 
the distribution of missing data across megagametophytes. We also varied the threshold determining 
the number of consecutive loci allowed to have incorrect genotypes. Specifically, we 
examined using as thresholds, 1\%, 5\%, and 10\% of the number of loci per cluster as being erroneous. We chose to 
examine the effects of these threshold values in a fully factorial design requiring 15 treatment comparisons. As such we restricted 
analysis to the largest linkage group for the maternal tree with the largest number of reads used to construct 
the assembly. For each treatment combination we produced a new ordering, and when loci were shared, we calculated 
the Spearman rank correlation of all possible pairwise combinations of the $15$ orderings (i.e., {$15 \choose 2$} = $105$ unique 
comparisons). The significance of each comparison was tested via permutation analysis ($n = 10,000$ permutations) 
using a Bonferroni-corrected significance threshold of $\alpha = 0.05$. Non-significant values were taken as evidence of significantly 
different orderings.

\subsection*{Consensus Map Construction and Biological Interpretation}\label{ss:consensus}
The four linkage maps, one for each maternal tree, were combined into a consensus map using MergeMap \citep{Wu:2008b}. This 
method uses Directed Acylic Graphs (DAGs) to merge independent linkage maps into a consensus linkage map.

\section*{Results}

\subsection*{DNA Sequence Analysis}

Megagametophytes from each maternal tree are 
collectively referred to as libraries. Each library has color-coded name (Figure \ref{f:Figure01_TGG}).
The raw number of reads varied across libraries from a minimum of
XX to a maximum of XX, with an average of XX. All raw reads were 108 bp in length. In 
general, the libraries run on the Illumina HiSeq 2500 platform had a XX-fold greater 
number of reads than those run on the 
Illumina 2000 HiSeq platform. Processing of reads for quality reduced these numbers by 
approximately XX-fold, with a range 
of XX-fold (XXXX) to XX-fold (XXXXX) reduction. After filtering, the average
length of reads was XX bp, with a range of XX to XX across libraries. 
The number of quality-filtered reads per megagametophyte also varied XX-fold on average 
across libraries, with minimums of approximately XX to maximums of approximately XX. 
Further details about the raw and filtered read data are given in Table S1.

The megagametophyte from each library with the largest number of reads
was used to create an assembly for downstream read mapping and SNP calling.
Optimization of the hash length resulted in assemblies being created with different values of 
$k$ across libraries (Figure \ref{f:mapping_performance}). The optimal value of $k$ was $31$ for 
both of the libraries sequenced using the Illumina HiSeq2500 platform, while it was $33$ for the
libraries sequenced using the HiSeq2000 platform (Table 1, Fig. 2). These values differed from those that would
have been identified using a summary statistic based on the percent of mapped reads (Fig. 2), with the
summary statistic method supporting lower values of $k$ in all instances. In general, the optimal assembly
included \SIrange{60}{70}{\%} of the available reads. 

These four assemblies, one per library, were used to call SNPs and genotypes of those SNPs as described in the \nameref{ss:mats}. 
The number of called SNPs varied dramatically across libraries (yellow: $373,022$; blue: $263,088$; red: $119,975$; green: $653,861$). 
After filtering, the numbers of SNPs dropped approximately $73$\% (range: \SIrange{71.6}{76.4}{\%}), so that the number of SNPs
ranged from $28,322$ to $178,715$ (Table 1). The average percent of missing data across megagametophytes 
varied from $XX$ to $XX$ across libraries (Table 1), with an average of $XX$. The number of shared contigs across the four 
libraries containing these SNPs was $XX$ (Figure SX). When considered by regional population, this number increased to $XX$ and $XX$.
There was no relationship between the platform used to sequence the library and the number of shared contigs, 
so that assemblies from DNA sequences produced on the HiSeq2500 were no more likely to share contigs than assemblies 
from DNA sequences produced on the HiSeq2000 (Fisher's exact test: \textit{P} = $0.XX$).

\subsection*{Supplementary Text}\label{ss:supp}

\textbf{Simulation of Meiosis} - Simulations ($n = 200$) were used to explore 
the effect of missing data and genotyping error on clustering. We 
used a simple case of a single maternal tree with two chromosomes each of which contained 100 loci
with an average spacing of \SI{1.5}{cM} ($\pm$ \SI{0.5}{cM}).
The remainder of the data structure followed that observed for the red library and the general framework from \citet{Hackett:2003}. This library was selected
because it had the lowest coverage, largest amount of missing data, and fewest SNPs.
Recombination was modeled within chromosomes as a process comprised of only simple crossing-over. If a recombination event occurred, a site within the chromosome
was selected at random to define the breakpoint. After recombination, one of the two resulting haplotypes was
selected at random with equal probability. This process was repeated $n = 76$ times to create
an array of gametes for each chromosome. Once finished, genotyping error was introduced as a constant
probability of $0.10$, so that one of the known haploid genotypes was changed to the alternate allele with probability $0.10$. 
After introduction of errors, missing data were simulated by randomly removing data for each
of the 76 haplotypes at random using the level of missing data observed for each haplotype in the red library
as the per locus probability of being missing. For example, if an observed haplotype had $2\%$ missing data
then the per locus probability of making a given haploid genotype missing was 0.02. The resulting data were
clustered following the procedure outlined in \nameref{ss:linkage} using the known number of clusters ($K = 2$).
This process was repeated $200$ times and for each replication the fraction of incorrectly classified loci was
estimated. All simulations were performed with custom scripts in R \citep{R:2013}.
